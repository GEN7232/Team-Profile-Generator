In this assignment I created tests for each employee type as well as the parent Employee file. Once they all passed tests using jest, I started setting classes and functions using inquirer to ask the user questions about each team member. Once the user hits done an html page is populated with a jumbotron that says team. I'd like to add cards per each added team member, but sadly I got stuck. I plan to go to office hours with what I have and then resubmit. Thank you for taking the time to grade this first one. Any constructive criticism is greaty appreciated.

EDIT/RESUMBIT: In this assignment I got stuck on connecting the front end to the back end. I had to create functions to generate each card, and have spaces in the html for the cards to be.
